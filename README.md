# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
Shallow network with combined pooling for fast traffic sign recognition (Zhang et al)

## Overview:
A Deep Learning model that utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) along with dropout and multi scale features
to identify traffic signs in images. The dataset used is the <a href="http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news">German Traffic Sign Dataset</a>. The trained model achieves around 96% accuracy on the test set. Details given in report.pdf

## Dependencies:
Python<br>
Tensorflow<br>
cPickle<br>

## Running the project:
1. Download the dataset from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/135V68jeqQdYt2N6i0WKzWu3ZWBjru2PX/view?usp=sharing"> here </a> and put it in the root folder
2. Setup Tensorflow on local machine
2. Run "python tsr.py" from root directory
