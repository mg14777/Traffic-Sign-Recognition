# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
Shallow network with combined pooling for fast traffic sign recognition (Zhang et al)

## Overview:
A Deep Learning model that utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) along with dropout and multi scale features
to identify traffic signs in images. The dataset used is the German Traffic Sign Dataset. The trained model achieves around 96% accuracy
on the test set. Details given in report.pdf

## Dependencies:
Python
Tensorflow
cPickle

## Running the project:
1. Download the dataset from <> and put it in the root folder
2. Setup Tensorflow on local machine
2. Run "python tsr.py" from root directory
